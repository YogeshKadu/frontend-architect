# Frontend Architect / Senior React Engineer

## Step1: Study

That means mastering:

- React internals (hooks, rendering, performance)
- State management patterns
- Micro-frontend architecture
- Testing + accessibility
- Build tools (Vite, Webpack basics)
- System design for frontend

## Step 3: Build proof, not hope

You need:

- 2–3 solid, well-documented projects
- Clean GitHub
- Ability to explain design decisions clearly

# Target (12 months)

**Role:** Senior Frontend Engineer / Frontend Architect Track<br/>
**Target CTC:** 15–22 LPA (first jump)<br/>
**Tech focus:** React + System Design + Quality

# Syllabus

## Foundation Lock-in

1. React rendering lifecycle
2. Hooks: `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useRef` (when & why)
3. Controlled vs uncontrolled components
4. Lifting state vs context vs Redux
5. Performance basics

📌 Rule: Don’t just “use” things — explain why.

## Build Proof Projects

You need 3 projects that scream “senior”.

1. Component Library (High impact)
	* Reusable components
	* Accessibility (ARIA)
	* Theming
	* Storybook
	* Proper documentation

2. Scalable Dashboard
	* Role-based access
	* Lazy loading
	* API caching
	* Error boundaries
	* Feature-based folder structure

3. Micro-frontend Demo
	* Host + remote
	* Shared state strategy
	* Versioning discussion
	* Performance tradeoffs

## Interview Weaponization

Now we convert skill → salary.

You must prepare:
* Frontend system design answers
* Tradeoff discussions
* Past project storytelling (STAR method)
