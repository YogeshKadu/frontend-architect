## How react work ?

React operates by creating an in-memory [virtual DOM] rather than directly manipulating the browser’s DOM.
It performs necessary manipulations within this virtual representation before applying changes to the actual browser DOM.

{: .note}
> ReactJS [Virtual DOM] is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). React uses this lightweight JavaScript object to track changes in the application state and efficiently update the actual DOM only where necessary.
