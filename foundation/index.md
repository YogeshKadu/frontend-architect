# Foundation

Your only goal right now is clarity and consistency, not speed.

### Daily rule (non-negotiable)

⏱ 2 hours/day, 5 days a week Phone away. No LinkedIn scrolling.

## Week 1 Focus: React Core (Depth > Breadth)

Topics to lock in:

* How React renders (initial render vs re-render)
* Reconciliation in simple terms
* Props vs state
* Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
* Why keys matter

## Week 2 Focus: Hooks (Real Understanding)

Must-know hooks

* `useState` (functional updates)
* `useEffect` (dependencies, cleanup)
* `useRef` (when NOT to use state)
* `useMemo` & useCallback (tradeoffs)

If you use useMemo everywhere, you don’t understand it.
